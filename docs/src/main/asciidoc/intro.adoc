Spring Cloud Release Train is a curated set of dependencies across a
range of Spring Cloud projects. You consume it by using the
spring-cloud-dependencies POM to manage dependencies in Maven or
Gradle. The release trains have names, not versions, to avoid
confusion with the sub-projects. The names are an alphabetic sequence
(so you can sort them chronologically) with names of London Tube
stations ("Angel" is the first release, "Brixton" is the second).

== Generating release train documentation

In order to generate the release train documentation, please update the project with versions for a given release train and then execute the following command:

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean install -Pdocs,train-docs -pl train-docs
```

In order to upload the documentation to the documentation server just execute the following command:

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean deploy -Pdocs,train-docs -pl train-docs
```
